# Welcome to SmartChild app ðŸ‘‹

SmartChild is an educational platform designed specifically for children. This app aims to provide engaging and interactive learning experiences through lessons, quizzes, and progress tracking.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Project Overview

EduPlatformApp is an educational mobile application that includes the following features:

- User Authentication: Secure sign-in and sign-up functionality.
- Interactive Lessons: Multimedia lessons designed for various subjects.
- Quizzes: Engaging quizzes to test knowledge and reinforce learning.
- Progress Tracking: Track progress and performance over time.
- User Profiles: Personalized profiles for students to track their learning journey.

## Technologies Used

- React Native: For building the mobile application.
- Expo: To streamline development and deployment processes.
- Firebase: For backend services such as authentication and data storage.
- React Navigation: For smooth and intuitive navigation within the app.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
